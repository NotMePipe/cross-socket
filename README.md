# CrossSocket
A lightweight, cross-platform C++ Socket API 
## Usage
Currently, releases only contain the source code for CrossSocket. The source contains CMakeLists which can be used to compile binaries for your own use. CrossSocket has the capability to be included in your project as a static or shared library; it is ultimately up to you

## C library
There currently aren't any plans to turn CrossSocket into a C library. If this library somehow gets any kind of traction and a C library is something people want, then I might start looking into making that change
